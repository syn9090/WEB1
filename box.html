    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <h1>CSS</h1>Cascading Style Sheets (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>) is a style sheet language sued for describing thead
    presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. [1] CSS is a cornerstone
    technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. [2] CSS is designed to enable
    the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. [3] This
    separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
    specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the
    structural content.
